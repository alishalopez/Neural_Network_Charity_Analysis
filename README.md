# Neural Network Charity Analysis
## Overview
We used a provided dataset to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting success of 34,000 potential organizations. Beks is able to forecast investments and whether they are profitable for Alphabet Soup.
 
## Results

### Data Preprocessing
* Our target was the “IS_SUCCESSFUL” column, as we are wanting successful investments.
*  Name, Application Type, Classification, Organization and Status were kept as features for this analysis.
* EIN and NAME were removed from the input data.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
* I was not able to get my target accuracy score of 75%.
* I added a hidden layer and changed the number of neurons to 165 to change the score. 

## Summary
I got an average result for my results and was not too pleased. A Random Forest may be an alternate model for this analysis.
